                        geographical region. Our approach is implemented at two levels first to realize the
                        user-specific features and the latter to actuate the safe route generation using a set of e
                        cient algorithms. We visualize the determined routes through a colour-code based map
                        user interface.</p>

                        Bezier curves approximation technique. The implementation was accompanied by a

                        a series of tweets, we examine the possibility of classifying them into di erent mood
                        classes. From each tweet, we extract di erent sets of functions, refer to a manually
                        annotated training set, and use machine learning to perform the classification through
                        the use of Apache Spark. </p>

                      <p>All our lives we’ve slogged through hours of theoretical lectures, sessions on a daily basis, and examinations without ever questioning the efficiency of these traditional systems. The few people that did raise questions, well they weren’t really able to convince the majority against it and failed to bring a change. Therefore it is essential to question the present education system and determine if formal education can be considered a significant parameter to gauge success.</p>

                   <p>There are a variety of factors and qualities that govern an individual’s perspective of themselves. Life is never a straight road for any of us, and it throws twists and turns in our paths all the time. It is the situations we face and the hardships we go through that make us who we are. What we think of ourselves is very important, so we know what’s right for us and what exactly we need in life. </p>

                   <p>One of the best innovations that I’ve come across is something that I feel has made a significant impact on the globalization of trade and shopping and has completely changed the approach people have towards spending on luxury items because of the sense of satisfaction it brings to them.
                    My reference here is to the online shopping apps that open the doors to quality merchandise, goods, and commodities right through our phones, making the customer experience better and more efficient than ever before.</p>
